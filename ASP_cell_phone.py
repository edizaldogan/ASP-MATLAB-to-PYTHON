Chapter 1 - How is speech processed in a cell phone conversation?
This is a companion file to the book "Applied Signal Processing",
by T. Dutoit and F. Marques, Springer 2008.

In this script, we will see how LPC-based analysis-synthesis lies at the
very heart of mobile phone transmission of speech. We will first examine
the contents of a speech file, in Section 1. Then we will perform LP
analysis and synthesis on a voice and on an unvoiced frame, in Sections 2
and 3 respectively. We will then generalize this approach to the complete
speech file, by first synthesizing all frames as voiced and imposing a
constant pitch, in Section 4, then by synthesizing all frames as unvoiced
in section 5, and finally by using the original pitch and voicing
information, in Section 6.

1. Examining a speech file
Let us load file 'speech.wav', listen to it, and plot its samples. This
file contains the sentence "Paint the circuits" sampled at 8 kHz, with 16
bits. (This sentence was taken from the Open Speech Repository on the
web)
'''

# MATLAB normalizes the value between the range -1 and 1 with the function audioread.
# However, Python reads the raw format which ranges between -32768 and 32767
# To normalize we use the following equation: audio = audio_raw / 32768
import numpy             as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.io            import wavfile
sample_rate, audio_raw   = wavfile.read("speech.wav")
audio = audio_raw / 32768
total_duration       = len(audio)
speech_time          = np.arange(0, total_duration, 1)
y_tick_marks         = np.arange(-1.0, 1.1, 0.1)
x_tick_marks         = np.arange(0,10000, 2000)
plt.figure  (figsize=(10, 8))
plt.title   ("Speech Signal")
plt.yticks  (y_tick_marks)
plt.xticks  (x_tick_marks)
plt.xlabel  ("Time [samples]")
plt.ylabel  ("Amplitude")
plt.plot    (speech_time, audio)
plt.grid    (True)
plt.show    ()

The file is about 1.1 s long (9000 samples). One can easily spot the
position of the four vowels in this plot, since vowels usually have
higher amplitude than other sounds. The vowel 'e' in "the", for instance,
is approximately centered on sample 3500.

As such, however, the speech waveform is not "readable", even by an
expert phonetician. Its information (phonetic) content is hidden. In
order to reveal it to the eyes, let us plot a spectrogram of the signal.
For a better graphical result, we choose a wideband spectrogram, by
imposing the length of each frame to be approximately 5 ms long (40
samples) and a hamming weighting window.
